## Learning to code with the roulette and answering if we are alone in the universe
We provide the best strategy to win at roulette. This result is supported with algorithms developed in Matlab. Using them, we proceed to explain if there is intelligent life on other planets, that is, we define a relationship between the roulette and the existence of extraterrestrial life.

**Instructions**

There are 3 files:

1. `roulette-deterministic.m` : The bet is fixed, e.g., red color bet.
2. `roulette-stochastic.m` : The bet is random, e.g., in each round a random number is chosen.
3. `roulette-martingale.m` : The bet considers the Martingale strategy.

Open the file in `Matlab` or `Octave` and run it.

**Note:** All files require an input value. Details are self-explained in the code. For the parameters given (`laps = 1000000`), each file takes to compute less than 5 minutes in `Matlab` and 15 to 60 minutes in `Octave`. To reduce the computation time, consider a smaller number for `laps`.
